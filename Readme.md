#Instagram for Cats

This is a sharing app for iOS. For development testing, cats were created as users. It was originally created to connect scholarship-seeking sports stars with college sports recruiters, but It was subsequently re-engineered as something more relevant to a wider audience, and it is up on the App Store as an uplifting app called Wings for Youth. Users may log in via Facebook or email using Parse. Photos can be taken from the camera or gallery and new or saved captions may be added to photos as they are posted. A search bar allows the user to find and follow or unfollow other users. Photos and captions from other users also appear in the home feed and can be liked or flagged for removal, the latter being a feature required by the App Store.
